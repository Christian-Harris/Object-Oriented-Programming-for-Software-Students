## Bio
Hi, my name is Christian Harris. I am 28 years old and married to a loving wife. We are currently
expecting our first baby boy and are very excited. I like to play games, especially Magic the Gathering.
We have a small dog named Denali who is very spoiled.
My background is primarily in mathematics. I have a bachelors degree in mathematics from Dixie State University.
I have also have a background in philosophy.

##Personal Statement
I was recently pursuing a Masters degree at Utah State University. Because of some difficulty
with my wife's health it became unfeasable for me to complete this degree. Southwest Tech
has offered me a chance to quickly obtain the skills I need to support my family. My goals are to
find a good job in the industy which I can stay at for a long time. I'm not too picky. All I really
want is to make cool stuff and keep my skills sharp.
